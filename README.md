# FPS-Environment
x3dom 3D Scene with Interactive FPS Point of View


# Overview
This repository contains a 3D scene created with the x3dom library, which showcases three exterior models: a house, a bathroom, and a spotlight. The scene also features an FPS (First Person Shooter) point of view, allowing the user to walk around the environment and interact with different materials.

The user can switch the lights on and off, switch between red and blue light, and change the texture of the bathroom floor. These interactions are made possible through the use of JavaScript and the x3dom library.
